## Introduction

String matching is a fundamental problem in computer science with applications in text processing, search engines, bioinformatics, and more. This repository provides implementations of several classic string matching algorithms, along with explanations and examples.

## Algorithms

### Naive String Matching

The naive string matching algorithm checks for the pattern at all positions in the text, making it straightforward but inefficient for large texts.

### Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm

The KMP algorithm improves the naive approach by using preprocessing to avoid redundant comparisons, achieving linear time complexity.

### Boyer-Moore Algorithm

The Boyer-Moore algorithm skips sections of the text, using information from the pattern to jump ahead, making it efficient for longer texts.

### Rabin-Karp Algorithm

The Rabin-Karp algorithm uses hashing to find patterns, allowing for efficient average-case performance.
